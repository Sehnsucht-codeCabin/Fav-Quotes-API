# Fav Quotes API

## What is this -->
This is a sample web app based on Fav Quotes [API](https://favqs.com/api). It was built on a simple [package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/simple-react-app) I stumbled upon when trying to find an alternative to the default 'create-react-app'.

Cheers!

## ðŸš€ Quick start

1.  **Install dependencies.**

    Navigate into your new siteâ€™s directory and start it up by installing the required dependencies.

    ```sh
    cd my-default-starter/
    npm install
    ```

1.  **Current outcome**

    Navigate into your new siteâ€™s directory and start it up.

    ```sh
    npm start
    ```

1.  **Develop**

    Your site is now running at `http://localhost:3000`!

    Open the `my-default-starter` directory in your code editor of choice and edit any files inside `src/` directoy. Save your changes and the browser will update in real time!


## Tests

The testing environment is written in Jest and Enzyme.
The included tests are very basic and currently only the reducers tests are passing, I have yet to check on some units tests which are failing probably as a result of the Redux implementation.

To check on any currently implemented tests:

```sh
npm run test
```


## Eslint

This project uses Eslint so you can write error-free react and javasctipt code, if you use Visual Studio Code, you can install Eslint from the extension tab.
